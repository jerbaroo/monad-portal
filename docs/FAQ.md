## Why the Name Telescope?
The `telescope` package provides an interface to read/write remote data i.e.
data stored in a database or data accessed over the network. This interface is
"lens-like" i.e. the functions are similar to the functions `view`, `set` etc.
that you may know from the `lens` library. So if you squint your eyes a little
you could say this library provides a lens to look at remote data... like a
telescope.
