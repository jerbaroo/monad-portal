# Telescope

**In development. Not production ready.**

Telescope helps you build reactive web apps with Haskell, fast. Telescope
achieves this by abstracting away common tasks you need to undertake when
developing a web app, **allowing you to focus on your data** and **reducing the
time you need to build your app**.

With Telescope..
- you don't need to setup a database, Telescope can handle this for you.
- you don't need to setup a server, Telescope can handle this for you.
- you can write the same language (Haskell) server-side and client-side.
- server-side and client-side code use the same functions for database access!
- you don't have to worry about keeping client-side and server-side data in sync.
- your frontend will automatically react to changes in your database!

What does Telescope not do?
- Provide a full featured database query library e.g. SQL.
- Generate a small file to be sent to browser clients.

## Is Telescope for me?

Telescope is particularly well-suited for applications where events are pushed
by the server e.g. notifications and dashboards. Telescope also hands forms and
input very validation. On the flip-side, applications with heavy client-side
computation such as animations are not well-suited for Telescope.

Telescope is built to be integrated with the wonderul
[Reflex](https://reflex-frp.org/) and [Servant](https://www.servant.dev/)
libraries.

## Typical Workflow

Building a reactive web app with Telescope looks something like this:

**1.** Declare the data types used in your application.

``` haskell
data TodoList = TodoList {
    name  :: String
  , items :: [String]
  } deriving (Generic, Show)

instance PrimaryKey TodoList where
  primaryKey = name
```

**2.** Populate your database with some dummy data so you can test your app.

``` haskell
T.set $ TodoList "pancakes" ["eggs", "milk", "flour"]
```

**3.** Start the Telescope server (or integrate it with your existing
[Servant](https://www.servant.dev/) Server).

``` haskell
Server.run port
```

**4.** Write the frontend of your reactive web app with [Reflex](https://reflex-frp.org/)!

``` haskell
-- NOTE: work in progress.
main = mainWidget $ el "div" $ do
  el "h3" $ text "View a list:"
  input   <- textInput def
  results <- T.view (constant TodoList{}) $ updated $ input ^. textInput_value
  dynText =<< (holdDyn "No results." $ (pack . show) <$> results)
```

**5.** Modify data in your database and watch your frontend react!

``` haskell
T.over $ TodoList{} "pancakes" (\list -> list ++ ["sugar", "lemon juice"])
```

## Architecture

The most important component from a user-perspective is the Telescope interface,
a set of functions that allow you to access external data. The same functions
that this interface provides can be used server-side and client-side.

The following diagram shows the typical setup of a Telescope application. In
this diagram each telescope icon represents usage of the Telescope interface. A
server, and a local developer over a terminal, are accessing the database via
the Telescoper interface. A browser client is accessing the server via the
Telescope interface, however the server is really just a proxy for the database,
so the browser client in effect is accessing the database via the Telescope
interface the same as the lcal developer.

## Motivation

There are many different web frameworks out there, and they all have pros and
cons. They pretty much all allow you to write reuseable components. Some can
ship a small file to the client, some allow you to write your server-side and
client-side code in the same language, some can pre-render server-side for a
speedy TTI (time to interactive).

One idea that has become fairly popular in recent years is that of a reactive
frontend. Whereby the view is written as a function of the current state, and
whenever the state changes, the view "reacts" to the change and is updated.

Implementations of reactive frontends vary, one possible implementation is
"data-binding", available as one-way in React and two-way in Polymer. With this
implementation the data "flows" up/down your tree of components. With React you
still have to do some work in order to update parent nodes because the binding
is only one-way (parent to child). A solution to this problem with React is to
the library Redux to manage state.

Polymer and Vue provide more powerful solutions for data flow that allow you to
write your frontend as a function of your application state. However, in both
cases you still have to manage communication with your server. The primary
motivation behind the Telescope framework is that a developer should be able to
write their frontend as a function of data in their database, liberated from
concerns of where data is stored or when the view is updated.

## Development

Install the [Nix](https://nixos.org/download.html) package manager, clone this
repository (with submodules) and change in to the `telescope` directory. If
youâ€™ve never built a project with `reflex-platform` before you'll also need to
run a configuration step. Initial setup will take a looong time.

``` bash
curl -L https://nixos.org/nix/install | sh
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/jerbaroo/telescope
cd telescope
./reflex-platform/try-reflex # Configure reflex-platform.
```

To run the demo application:

``` bash
# Runs a server with a database containing some dummy data.
./scripts/run-backend.sh
# Builds the frontend with Nix & GHC and starts a frontend server.
# Once the server is running visit localhost:3003 in a browser.
./scripts/run-frontend.sh
```

Commands for developing the demo application:

``` bash
# Builds the backend with Cabal & GHC.
./scripts/build-backend.sh
# Builds the frontend with Nix & GHCJS (producing an index.html file).
./scripts/build-frontend.sh
```

Commands for developing the Telescope framework:

``` bash
# Builds all Telescope packages.
./scripts/build-telescope.sh
# Runs tests for Telescope packages.
./scripts/test-telescope.sh
# Runs GHCID for the telescope package.
./scripts/ghcid.sh telescope
```

## Name

Before this framework was able to setup a database or a server, it was really
just a data access library. Providing functions to access remote data i.e. data
stored in a database, or accessing data over the network. These functions are
"lens-like", they are similar to the functions `view`, `set` etc. that you may
know from the `lens` library. So if you squint your eyes a little you could say
the library provides a lens to look at remote data... like a telescope.
